                Dat Boi is the newest frog token on the block(chain).  He loves to travel the world on his unicycle,
                 and never passes on an opportunity to greet anybody that he comes
                across during his adventures.  Now that he has entered
                the crypto world, he hopes to create a similarly welcoming community for all to enjoy.
                Make sure to welcome all new $DATBOI holders with a 'O SHIT WADDUP!'
